# üöÄ Deploy VantagePoint CRM to AWS Production

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Code is ready and pushed to Git
- ‚úÖ AWS credentials configured (Account: 337909762852)
- ‚ùå Infrastructure not yet deployed to AWS

## Option 1: Quick Deploy to AWS (Recommended)

This will create your full production infrastructure in AWS:
- RDS PostgreSQL database
- ElastiCache Redis
- Lambda functions
- API Gateway
- Cognito user pool
- S3 buckets
- CloudWatch monitoring
- Security (WAF, GuardDuty, CloudTrail)

### Step 1: Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
cd infrastructure

# Deploy to production
./scripts/deploy.sh production deploy
```

**Estimated Time:** 15-20 minutes  
**Estimated Cost:** ~$343/month

### Step 2: Get Database Credentials

After deployment, get your RDS endpoint:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name VantagePoint-production \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`DatabaseEndpoint`].OutputValue' \
  --output text
```

Get database password from Secrets Manager:

```bash
aws secretsmanager get-secret-value \
  --secret-id vantagepoint/database/credentials \
  --query SecretString \
  --output text | jq -r .password
```

### Step 3: Create Admin User

```bash
# SSH into Lambda or use local connection to RDS
# Then run the same admin creation script
```

## Option 2: Use Existing AWS RDS (If You Have One)

If you already have an RDS PostgreSQL database running, tell me the details and I'll configure the app to use it.

---

## Option 3: Deploy to AWS Amplify (Frontend Only)

If you want to deploy just the frontend quickly:

```bash
cd frontend-nextjs

# Install Amplify CLI
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli

# Initialize
amplify init

# Deploy
amplify publish
```

---

## Option 4: Use Local Development (Not for Production)

For local testing only, we can keep using localhost PostgreSQL. But this is NOT production-ready.

---

## Which Option Do You Want?

**For production, I recommend Option 1** - Deploy the full AWS infrastructure. This will:

1. Create a secure, scalable RDS PostgreSQL database
2. Set up all AWS services (Redis, Lambda, API Gateway)
3. Configure security (WAF, encryption, audit logging)
4. Provide monitoring and alerting
5. Enable blue-green deployments

The infrastructure code is already written and ready to deploy!

Just run:

```bash
cd infrastructure
./scripts/deploy.sh production deploy
```

Let me know which option you want, and I'll help you get it done! üöÄ
